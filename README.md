# Bike Sharing
Module 14

## Overview of the project:
The purpose of this project was to analyze New York City bike sharing to learn more about the business model and apply it to Des Moines.

## Results:
•	For this analysis, we used `Tableau Public` to visualize multiple data from NYC Citi Bike. First, we generated a map of hotspot circles where we can see that central areas are the most popular.

•	Next, we generated a pie graph for users by gender and found that men represented roughly 65% of clients.

•	In the following bar graph, we plotted users by age and found most cyclists were between 24 to 40 years old.

•	Next, we looked at trip duration for customers versus subscribers and found that customers, possibly tourists, will ride longer but account for less than one fifth of the rides. Customers ride between 8 and 26 minutes while subscriber ride around 2 to 12 minutes, possibly for commuting.

•	When we look at starting time for each rides, we can see that bike sharing is very popular between 7 am and 9 pm with spikes during morning and evening rush hour (8-10 am and 6-8 pm).

•	Similarly, looking at the hour by weekday by gender heatmap, we can see the same peak hour, especially for men but surprisingly, Wednesday evening was less busy than the other business days.

•	Our last analysis shows bike usage by bike id. We clearly see that some bicycles are used much more than others so we may need some rotation or more maintenance on those bikes.

## Summary:
•	Based on our analysis, we found that men, especially those between the age of 24 and 40, represent the target population. Therefore, if we want to find out if bike sharing would be sustainable in Des Moines, we need to compare the population of both cities. When looking at the population by age, both cities have similar percentage of 20 to 39 years old. Both cities also have similar ratio of male to female. The major difference is in the population size where New York city has 8.4 million while Des Moines only has about 0.22 million and probably less tourists as well. The business model may be viable on a smaller scale, but we would need more data on average commuting distance and more details on traffic in Des Moines to find out if bike sharing would be an attractive alternative. A look at average monthly temperature and precipitation might be useful as well to compare cyclable days with New York city.
